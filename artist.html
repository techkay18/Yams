                                                Justin Drew Bieber (/ˈbiːbər/ BEE-bər; born March 1, 1994)[1][2] is a Canadian singer and songwriter. Regarded as a pop icon, he is known for his multi-genre musical performances.[3][4] He was discovered by Scooter Braun in 2008 and brought to the U.S. by Usher, both of whom formed RBMG Records to sign Bieber in October of that year. His debut extended play, My World (2009), was met with international recognition and established him as a teen idol.

                                                Bieber rose to mainstream fame with his debut album, My World 2.0 (2010), which topped the US Billboard 200 — making him the youngest solo male to do so in 47 years.[5] Its lead single, "Baby" (featuring Ludacris), became one of the best selling singles in the U.S.[6] His second album, Under the Mistletoe (2011), became the first Christmas album by a male artist to debut atop chart.[7] Bieber explored dance-pop on his third album, Believe (2012); its acoustic re-release made him the first artist in Billboard history to have five US number-one albums by the age of 18.[8]

                                                Bieber explored EDM with his 2015 single "Where Are Ü Now", which won the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Recording.[9][10] This influenced his fourth album, Purpose (2015), which yielded the singles "Love Yourself", "Sorry", and "What Do You Mean?" — all three peaked the Billboard Hot 100, and simultaneously entered the top three spots on the UK singles chart — making him the first musical act to do so in the chart's history. Two of his 2017 guest appearances — on DJ Khaled's "I'm the One" and Luis Fonsi's "Despacito" — peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100, making him the first artist to replace himself atop chart with different songs in two consecutive weeks;[11] the latter won him a Latin Grammy Award.

                                                His fifth and sixth albums, Changes (2020) and Justice (2021), both topped the Billboard 200; the latter included his seventh US-number one single "Peaches" and made him break Elvis Presley's 1965 record for the youngest solo act to have eight US number-one albums. Also in 2021, he released his eighth US number-one single, "Stay" (with the Kid Laroi). Bieber's seventh album and its reissue, Swag and Swag II, were released in 2025.

                                                Bieber is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with over 150 million units sold worldwide and five diamond certifications from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[12] His accolades include two Grammy Awards, one Latin Grammy Award, eight Juno Awards, two Brit Awards, 26 Billboard Music Awards, 18 American Music Awards, and 22 MTV Europe Music Awards (the most wins for any artist). Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, and Forbes' listed him among the top ten most powerful celebrities from 2011 to 2013.[13] Billboard ranked him the eighth-greatest pop star of the 21st century.

                                           <p>
                                                Justin Drew Bieber was born on March 1, 1994, at St. Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario,[14] and was raised in Stratford.[15] His parents Jeremy Jack Bieber and Pattie Mallette were both 18 when Bieber was born and split up not long after his birth.[16] Pattie worked a series of low-paying office jobs, raising Bieber as a single mother in low-income housing. Mallette's mother Diane and stepfather Bruce helped her raise Bieber.[17] Bieber has maintained contact with his father.[18] Bieber's ancestry includes French, Irish, English, Scottish and German.[19][20][21]

                                                Bieber has three younger half-siblings; the four have the same father, Jeremy Bieber. Jeremy Bieber and his ex-girlfriend, Erin Wagner,[22] who broke up in 2014 after seven years together, have two children, daughter Jazmyn and son Jaxon.[23] Jeremy married his girlfriend Chelsey in February 2018, and they have a daughter named Bay.[24][25] Bieber also has a stepsister named Allie, the daughter of his stepmother.[26] Bieber attended two French-language immersion elementary schools in Stratford, Jeanne Sauvé Catholic School[17] and Bedford Public School. In grades 7 and 8, he attended Stratford Northwestern. Former teacher, Kim Booker often recalled fond memories of Bieber as her student, and is featured in several interviews. He attended Stratford's St. Michael Catholic Secondary School, and graduated in 2012[27] with a 4.0 GPA.[28]
                                                <br></br> 
                                                Growing up, he learned to play the piano, drums, guitar, and trumpet.[15][29] In early 2007, aged 12, Bieber performed Ne-Yo's "So Sick" for a local singing competition in Stratford, in which he placed second.[29][30] Mallette posted a video of the performance on YouTube for their family and friends to see. She continued to upload videos of Bieber singing covers of various R&B songs, and Bieber's popularity on the site grew.[31] In the same year, Bieber busked shows in front of the Avon Theatre steps with a rented guitar during tourism season.[32]

                                                        While searching for videos of a different singer, Scooter Braun, a former marketing executive of So So Def Recordings, clicked on one of Bieber's 2007 YouTube videos by accident, where he was covering Ne-Yo's "So Sick".[18][33] Impressed, Braun tracked down Bieber's school, the theatre Bieber was performing at, and finally contacted his mother Mallette, who was initially reluctant because of Braun's Judaism. She remembered praying, "God, I gave him to you. You could send me a Christian man, a Christian label!", and, "God, you don't want this Jewish kid to be Justin's man, do you?" However, church elders convinced her to let Bieber go with Braun. At age 13, Bieber went to Atlanta, Georgia, with Braun to record demo tapes.[18] Bieber began singing for Usher one week later.[34] Bieber soon signed with Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG), a joint venture between Braun and Usher.[35] Justin Timberlake was reportedly also in the running to sign Bieber but lost the bidding war to Usher, partly due to the idea that two associated singers of the same name would confuse the market.[35][36]

                                                        Usher then sought assistance in finding a label home for the artist from then manager Chris Hicks, who helped engineer an audition with his contact L.A. Reid of the Island Def Jam Music Group.[37] Reid signed Bieber to Island Records in October 2008 (resulting in a joint venture between RBMG and Island Records) and appointed Hicks as executive vice-president of Def Jam, where he could manage Bieber's career at the label.[38][31][35][37] Bieber then moved to Atlanta with his mother to pursue further work with Braun and Usher.[35] Braun became Bieber's manager in 2008.[31]

                                                        Bieber's first single, "One Time", was released to radio while Bieber was still recording his debut album.[39] The song reached number 12 on the Canadian Hot 100 during its first week of release in July 2009,[31] and peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. During fall 2009, it had success in international markets.[40] The song was certified platinum in Canada and the US and gold in Australia and New Zealand.[41][42][43] His first release, an extended play titled My World, was released on November 17, 2009. The album's second single, "One Less Lonely Girl", and two promotional singles, "Love Me" and "Favorite Girl", were released exclusively on the iTunes Store and charted within the top 40 of the US Billboard Hot 100.[40] As a result, he became the first solo artist to have four singles chart in the top 40 of the Hot 100 before the release of a debut album.[44]
                                                        <br></br>

                                                        Bieber incorporates a variety of genres in his music, focusing mainly on pop,[244][245] R&B,[245][246] and occasionally dance-pop or EDM.[244] In 2010, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone asserted that the content of his music was "offering a gentle introduction to the mysteries and heartaches of adolescence: songs flushed with romance but notably free of sex itself".[247] During the initial years of his career, his musical style was noted for being aimed to a more teen pop and "bubblegum-ish" direction.[248] 
                                                        In January 2012, Bieber told V magazine: "I want to do it at my own pace. I don't want to start singing about things like sex, drugs and swearing. I'm into love, and maybe I'll get more into making love when I'm older. But I want to be someone who is respected by everybody."[249] But since then, Bieber gradually altered his artistry, with Peter Gicas of E! Online describing "PYD" as "sexed-up", while In Touch Weekly magazine said that his song with Maejor Ali and Juicy J "Lolly" might make his fans a bit uncomfortable because of its lyrics that refer to oral sex.[250][114] In 2015 Bieber released the EDM-fuelled album Purpose, where he collaborated with Skrillex,[251] and explored serious themes such as "life experiences", through "feel-good music".[252]

                                                        Bieber initially sang with a boy soprano voice,[253] before his voice broke, as was evidenced during the debut performance of "Pray" at the 2010 American Music Awards. Sean Michaels of The Guardian described puberty as "the biggest threat to his career" at the time.[254] Jody Rosen commented that Bieber sings with "swing and rhythmic dexterity" on his debut album, noting his tone to be "nasal".[247] Bieber started to receive voice coaching from Jan Smith in 2008.[255] 
                                                        <br>
                                                        As an adult singer, Bieber's voice type is tenor, with a vocal range spanning from the baritone A2 to the high tenor F5.[256][257] In a review of his Purpose album, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph complimented his "soft, supple and seductive singing".[258] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian also praised Bieber's "affectedly breathy voice", noting that "the voice soon palls, but the songs are often interesting."[259] Reviewing his 2021 album, Justice, Pitchfork commented: "Bieber is not a powerhouse vocalist, but he is a compelling one, casually dropping in a stray yodel here, a Mariah Carey–indebted set of runs there. His voice has a palatable smoothness; he's mastered push-and-pull dynamics, and he swings effortlessly from a placid chest voice to a zephyr of a falsetto."[260]
